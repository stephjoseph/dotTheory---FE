            We think about Discord like a growing neighborhood, designed for all
            the shapes and sizes of communities that call our service home -
            from small friend groups to music, gaming, or education Communities
            with thousands to even hundreds of thousands of members.&nbsp; ‍
          </p>

              target="_blank"
              >This year</a
            >, we set out to invest in these larger spaces by building new tools
            and features to help Community admins, moderators, creators, and the
            members they support, get the most out of Discord.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re excited to tell you about a few new things we’ve been cooking
            up and provide an update on one of our offerings for creator
            monetization:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              Starting today, we’re introducing <strong>AutoMod</strong>, a new
              moderation tool built directly into Discord to help protect
              Communities so everyone can find belonging within a safeguarded
              environment.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              For creators, we’re excited to share that<strong>
                Premium Memberships</strong
              >
              will expand to many more servers this summer.
            </li>
            <li>
              We’re also launching
              <strong>Discord Community Resources</strong> and the
              <strong>Discord Admin Community</strong> as new educational and
              networking resources for building and sustaining Communities.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>AutoMod is Your Newest Mod Team Helper</h2>
          <p>
            Behind the Communities people love to call home on Discord, there’s
            often a team of moderators who dedicate their time to organize and
            foster spaces for users to find belonging. Back in 2020, we
            introduced the
            <a href="https://discord.com/moderation" target="_blank"
              >Discord Moderator Academy</a
            >: a resource to equip moderators with guidance, mentoring, and
            training to understand common safety issues and other helpful ways
            to lead within their Communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We think of safety in three pillars at Discord - our internal Safety
            team works to ensure a safe and positive experience for users on the
            service, we provide tools for users to control who they interact
            with and how, and our community admins and moderators are at the
            forefront of enforcing Discord’s Community Guidelines, as well as
            their server’s own rules. As a server grows, mods and admins might
            find themselves dedicating an increasing amount of time to manually
            keep their server clear of unwanted behavior and content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Community moderating should feel rewarding and fulfilling, and we
            want to make it easier for moderators to maintain a clean space for
            members by empowering them with better tools. AutoMod is one of the
            things we have built alongside other safety initiatives to help keep
            Discord safe for all Communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            With AutoMod, moderators of all skill levels can quickly set up
            auto-moderation directly from server settings alongside pre-existing
            tools like Verification Levels, Slow Mode, and Server TimeOut. At
            launch, AutoMod comes equipped with keyword filters that
            automatically detect, block, and alert moderators of messages
            containing harmful words or phrases before they’re posted. AutoMod
            also gives moderators the ability to automatically time users out if
            a bad actor gets flagged, so your team can handle the situation when
            ready.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve compiled three starting lists that cover certain categories of
            not-nice words or phrases within a default Rule called “Commonly
            Flagged Rules.” Moderators can also experiment with up to three
            additional custom rules sets, allowing AutoMod to take action on
            anything your team wants it to.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div>
              <img src="../../images/automod-settings.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              You can specify what words AutoMod looks for, along with what
              actions to take. You can also exclude users or roles from the
              ruleset.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            AutoMod is available now on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and
            the web app. If you manage a Community server, you’ll find AutoMod
            within Server Settings. If your server isn’t a Community server yet,
            you can enable the features within Server Settings &gt; Community,
            then AutoMod will be available to you.
          </p>

          <h2>Premium Memberships is Expanding to Even More Communities</h2>
          <p>
            As you may recall, last December we began a
            <a
              href="https://discord.com/blog/building-sustainable-creator-communities-on-discord"
              target="_blank"
              >closed experiment</a
            >
            with Premium Memberships, allowing a small group of creators to test
            the ability to monetize access to parts or all of their server
            natively on Discord. Thanks to the feedback of our testing creators
            and Communities, we’ll be expanding more widely to eligible servers
            in the US later this summer.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div>
              <img src="../../images/premium-memberships.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              Premium Memberships offer a streamlined and simple way to offer
              premium experiences, content, and interactions within your
              community.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Our ongoing conversations with creators allowed us to prioritize the
            tools and features they need to best monetize their platforms, scale
            their businesses, and create engaging experiences for their
            Communities. Since our initial testing of Premium Memberships last
            December, we learned that creators want deeper revenue insights,
            additional perks for subscribers, and a way to provide their
            community with a sneak peek before committing to a subscription.
            With these insights in mind, we are excited to introduce a few new
            features in Premium Memberships:
          </p>

          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              <strong>A new analytics dashboard </strong>that provides insights
              on revenue categorized by date, membership tiers, and more
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A free trial period of Premium Memberships</strong>
              <strong>subscriptions</strong> to offer community members a sneak
              peek before purchase, and drive higher conversion&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A special pool of custom server emojis</strong>
              exclusively for your server’s Premium Memberships subscribers
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But our dedication to accessibility doesn’t stop with just these
            improvements: we're committed to being
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG Level 2.1 AA</a>
            compliant in the near future, and building towards that our team is
            thrilled to celebrate Disability Pride Month by rolling out a few
            new Accessibility features and improvements today on desktop, web,
            and iOS - with Android availability coming soon:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              <strong>Role Colors</strong>: Rather than an individual’s name
              being colored based upon your server roles, you can now display a
              colored dot next to a user’s name that takes on their role’s color
              instead. This can help in communities that use bright colors to
              signify their roles, or use role colors that may be harder to
              discern on Dark or Light themes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We can’t wait to see the ways Premium Memberships come to life as we
            work closely with creators to develop tools that deliver even more
            value to their Communities.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2>Introducing New Tools for Building and Supporting Communities</h2>
          <p>
            Behind every great community on Discord is an even greater team of
            admins and moderators. They’re truly essential to creating
            Communities where anyone can find belonging and are critical to
            growing incredible spaces for users to connect.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‍<br />As we continue to invest in ways to equip them with the tools
            they need to build and grow healthy communities, we’re excited to
            announce not just one, but two new resources for admins and
            moderators to grow and create the next great Discord
            community:&nbsp;
