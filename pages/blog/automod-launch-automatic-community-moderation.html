            If you’ve found a community you love to call home on Discord,
            there’s a team of moderators dedicating their time to organizing and
            fostering that space for you and your friends to find belonging. But
            as a community grows, your mods and admins will need to buff up
            their defenses from those looking to sour the fun.&nbsp; ‍
          </p>
          <p>
            And we want to help — to equip your moderation team with the tools
            to keep your community and conversations welcoming. To empower you
            to handle any bad actors whose sole intention being to litter chat
            with malicious language, harmful scams or links, and all sorts of
            spam.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Community moderation should be a hobby you celebrate, and stepping
            away to make time for yourself shouldn’t rack your mind with guilt
            of what could be happening when you’re gone. Moderating your growing
            community should feel rewarding and fulfilling, not add constant
            stress from dealing with bad actors or unruly members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Doing is better than saying, so we’ll be taking some of that
            moderation work off your hands and tackling it ourselves. Say hello
            to AutoMod, your new best friend in server moderation: up and about
            24 hours a day, 7 days a week, keeping your server clean and sleek!
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are a few recently added highlights that help make Discord
            better for everyone:

          <h2>Meet Your Newest Mod Team Member: AutoMod</h2>
          <p>
            Community moderators currently have to tackle the majority of their
            daily duties, such as meticulously monitoring chat and removing any
            harmful content manually as it happens. As a server continues to
            grow and responsibilities shift from helping out in your free time
            to spending every waking moment making sure memes aren’t posted in
            #general, you and your team may not be able to keep up and could
            burn out from not only moderating, but participating in your
            community entirely.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            AutoMod is here to take some of the load off your shoulders, working
            to keep your community and conversations clean around the clock so
            you can take time to enjoy yourself without stressing about what's
            happening when you're out and about. As your one-stop-shop for
            content moderation filters, AutoMod lives under the Content
            Moderation tab within your Community-enabled Server Settings. (Don’t
            have Community enabled on your server? Check out
            <a

              >this Help Center article</a
            >
            to see what you’re missing!)
          </p>
          <p>
            At launch, AutoMod comes equipped with keyword filters that can
            automatically detect, block, and alert you of messages containing
            harmful words or phrases before they're ever posted in your
            #text-channels, Threads, and inside your Text Chat in Voice. You can
            even have users who try to post harmful words or phrases be Timed
            Out automatically, so they won’t be able to continue posting until
            you’re back.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div>
              <img src="../../images/automod-illustration.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              On the left, what the user sees if their message is caught by
              AutoMod. On the right, what a relayed message to a moderator
              channel looks like.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            If you’ve chosen to have AutoMod send you alerts about flagged
            messages, you can specify it to post the alerts to a text channel of
            your choice. There, your moderation team can view a flagged message
            to determine the best course of action, whether it’s removing the
            message itself, timing out the user who tried to post it, or
            allowing it to remain.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            You might be reading this and thinking, “who determines what a
            harmful message is?” Easy: you do! Upon setting up AutoMod’s keyword
            filters, you and your moderation team will be able to set up and
            configure up to three of your own custom keyword filters. You’ll
            also be able to quickly set up a “Commonly Flagged Words” filter
            which lets you use ready-made wordlists that filter out a variety of
            not-so-nice words in categories like Severe Profanity, handy for
            when you don’t know where to start.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div>
              <img src="../../images/automod-settings.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              You’ll find AutoMod inside your Server Settings, in Content
              Moderation. Moderators with the “Manage Server” permission will be
              able to adjust AutoMod’s settings.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Since AutoMod’s built directly into your Discord server, it’s a
            great starting point for new communities looking to proactively keep
            their server safe. For long-standing servers with a seasoned team of
            moderators and self-crafted mod bots, AutoMod acts as an additional
            layer of protection in case something goes awry.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2>AutoMod’s Capabilities & How It Empowers Your Mods</h2>
          <p>
            As the newest moderation solution to safeguard your space, AutoMod
            lives inside
            <strong>Server Settings &gt; Content Moderation</strong> on
            desktop.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            AutoMod works by scanning your server’s written conversations —
            whether they take place in a traditional #text-channel, a Thread, or
            inside your Text Chat in Voice — for specific keywords, links or
            phrases.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, this won’t work without AutoMod knowing
            <em>*what*</em> to look for. That’s where your moderation team comes
            in!
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div>
              <img src="../../images/automod-rule-name.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              You can specify what words AutoMod looks for, along with what
              actions to take. You can also exclude users or roles from the
              ruleset.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            <strong
              >The content AutoMod searches for is completely
              customizable</strong
            >, from single words to complete phrases. Is your coffee server
            tired of people spelling&nbsp; certain caffeinated liquids as
            “expresso?” Add the misspelling to one of your custom rule sets, and
            once someone says “expresso” again, you can step in and give them a
            polite lesson on how to actually spell&nbsp; “espresso.”&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            To start, you can set up a “Commonly Flagged Words” filter which
            allows you to toggle three readily available wordlists that are
            designed for instant protective coverage against commonly flagged
            words. Once you’ve gotten familiar with how AutoMods functions, you
            can get creative and build up to three of your own custom filters
            that better fit your server’s unique needs.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div>
              <img src="../../images/automod-spell-check.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              In this example, AutoMod has caught someone spelling “espresso”
              incorrectly.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            As your community grows accustomed to your filters, you might
            discover people in your community trying to circumvent your filters
            and get harmful messages in circulation. So how can you block all
            kinds of words that partially match your keywords too?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            ‍<strong>Wildcards</strong> are here to help: By placing a *
            wildcard character at certain positions around your word or phrase,
            you can designate those words or phrases to be flagged when they
            appear in the beginning, middle, or end of other words.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>bake* ⇒ Today, we <strong>bake</strong>d some coffee cake</li>
            <li>*milk ⇒ I add soy<strong>milk</strong> to my coffee</li>
            <li>
              *press* ⇒ A Gibraltar is equal parts es<strong>press</strong>o and
              milk
            </li>
          </ul>
          <figure>
            <div>
              <img src="../../images/automod-content-moderation.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <figcaption>
              The flexibility of AutoMod allows you to specify what to do, to
              what messages, and where to alert your moderation team.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            From relaying potentially harmful messages to your mod team as they
            appear to timing out users for posting shady links or trying to
            sneakily post “fr3e D!sc0rd Nitr0,”
            <strong>AutoMod takes the actions that you tell it to</strong>,
            letting you return to what matters the most: bonding with your
            friends and community.&nbsp;
          </p>
